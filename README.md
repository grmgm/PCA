# PCA and Model Evaluation

## Overview. 

You will use files under the `Diabetes/` folder provided. The classification problem here is to predict whether or not a woman will be diagnosed with diabetes. Here's what the columns mean:
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Yes indicates that the person will be tested positive for diabetes, and No indicates that the person will not be tested positive for diabetes.
